# Sage projects

Please upload your code file and presentation file here when you are ready :-)

Ideally, you will use the following format, so we can identify you easily:

* For the folder: `TeamName`
* For the code/notebook: `TeamName_Topic.ipynb`
* For the documentation/presentation: `TeamName_Topic.pdf` or `TeamName_Topic.html`

In order to upload files to this repo, you will need to submit a pull request. You can test this process in the following way:

1. Clone or fork [the main repo](https://github.com/matematiflo/CompAssistedMath2024) if you have not done so already. We recommend doing it using GitHub Desktop.
2. In the `Sage/StudentsProjects` folder, create a subfolder `TeamName` (replacing *TeamName* with the name of your team) and put a `README.md` file in it, containing the title of your project and the names of the team members.
3. Commit your changes and submit a pull request (we recommend doing it using GitHubDesktop).

Thank you!
