## Installation of Sage via conda-forge

SageMath offers a [great installation guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/) for different OS. SageMath bundles a huge amount of different packages under one umbrella. This can make it a bit tricky to install. Luckily, for macOS and Linux (including WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux), we have Conda. [Conda](https://conda.org/) is a multi-platform package management ecosystem. Community-led distributions are available via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), including SageMath.

So, the only real thing you need is a working conda-forge installation. As [described here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html), you can install Miniforge, a Conda forge distribution. First, download it:

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
```

Then, run the script to install it:
```bash
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

After that, create a new conda environment containing SageMath. (Note that [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a package manager that serves as a faster drop-in replacement for `conda`. It comes pre-installed with Miniforge.)
```
mamba create -n sage sage python=3.11
```

This will download many packages, so it might take a while. It's also very big (it will install ~350 packages corresponding to ~1GB in size). Also feel free to use another Python version if you prefer.

After that, activate the new environment:
```bash
mamba activate sage
```

Now you can run `sage` to access the SageMath REPL that you can interact with in the terminal. But your commands won't get persisted, so a Jupyter Notebook might be a better choice. Read on if you want to use SageMath in Jupyter Notebooks inside VSCode.



### Usage of Sage in Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode

The widespread editor [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Studio Code) has great support for Jupyter notebooks via the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) (more than 77 Mio. people have already installed it as of April 2024).

The Jupyter extension itself does _not_ provide a kernel for SageMath, but if you followed along with the installation above, you've already created a working conda environment. VSCode will recognize this and shows you [an option](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook) in a Jupyter Notebook to select the SageMath kernel. And that's it, now you can work with SageMath in a Jupyter Notebook locally in VSCode ðŸŽ‰

Note that you might want to add

```py
from sage.all import *
```

at the beginning of the Jupyter notebook. This way, you will get proper IntelliSense including autocompletion. For example, write `ma` and press `Ctrl + Space` and you will see the available options, e.g. `matrix()`. But there's much more that IntelliSense can do for you.

You may also want to use the integrated terminal of VSCode (open it by pressing `Ctrl + J`). Here you can also type in `conda activate sage` to activate the environment with SageMath installed. Then type `sage` to start the SageMath REPL.
