- Some [basic tactics](08_basic_tactics.md) in Lean.

## Projects

Here are some Lean project suggestions (in format **Title** *(prerequisites)*: Goal).

1. **Convergence of sequences** *(Analysis 1)*: Prove basic properties of convergent sequences. Show that the sequence of the $n$-th root of $n$ converges to one.
1. **Continuity of real functions** *(Analysis 1)*: Define the notion of a continuous function. Explore some examples. Show the equivalence of continuity and left- and right-continuity combined.
1. **Affine isometries** *(Linear algebra 1)*: Define affine isometries and show that they are always of the form $x \mapsto g*x + y$ for some orthogonal matrix $g$.
1. **Inner automorphisms** *(Group theory)*: Define the group of inner automorphisms of a group. Show that the group $\mathrm{GL}_n(ℝ)$ has an automorphism that is not inner.
1. **Involutions** *(Group theory)*: Define involutions on groups. Prove that if a finite group has an involutive automorphism with no non-trivial fixed points, it is commutative. Construct a counter-example in the non-finite case.
1. **Divisibility in rings** *(Algebra 1)*: Define irreducible and prime elements of a ring. Define factorial rings and to show that in a factorial ring, every irreducible element is prime.
1. **Euclidean domains** *(Linear algebra 2 / Algebra 1)*:  Introduce principal ideal domains and Euclidean rings. Explore some examples and show that every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain. Potential extension: Smith Normal Form.
1. **Noetherian rings** *(Algebra 1)*: Define Noetherian rings and show a basic characterisation.
1. **Lagrange Polynomials** *(Linear Algebra 1)*: Define Lagrange polynomials and show that they form a basis of the vector space of bounded polynomials.
1. **The Schröder-Bernstein Theorem** *(Set theory)*: Prove the Schröder-Bernstein Theorem: If two sets $X$ and $Y$ have injections $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow X$, there exists a bijection $X \rightarrow Y$.
